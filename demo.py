    # consider plotting the policy. at least a timeslice of it.

    # I could try to turn the policy table into a polynomial
    # arrange states (with valid control laws) into a matrix A with 3 columns
    # Arrange the corresponding controls into a vector with the same length as A
    # Now we could easily solve for a linear policy by solving Ax=b with least squares
    # This would result in a linear control policy

    # To get higher order fit, I can put them into a matrix A where rows are 1,x,y,z,x^2,y^2,z^2,x^3,y^3,... (the 1 at the beginning allows a +c term)
    # least regressions on this gives me more coefficients show the linear example from above. Note that, using this function, we donâ€™t need to turn y into a column vector.
    # If I think an exponential function or somehting might fit better, I could use scipy.optimize.curve_fit to fit to arbitrary functions (returns coefficients)
